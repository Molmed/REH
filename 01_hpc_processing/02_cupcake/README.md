# Fusion detection with Cupcake

This workflow is based on: https://github.com/Magdoll/cDNA_Cupcake/wiki/Best-practice-for-fusion-transcript-finding

The scripts in this directory were run for IsoSeq files analysis-pt_047_001-6714-flnc.bam and analysis-pt_047_002-6715-flnc.bam.

The Cupcake output only contained ENSEMBL gene ids, not gene symbols. This was manually fixed with this tool: https://www.biotools.fr/mouse/ensembl_symbol_converter
